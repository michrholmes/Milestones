# Milestones
An application that keeps track of personal, family, work and business milestones. 
An organized way to log the big events in life to easily refer back to. 

For people like me that have a hard time remembering dates of important events in life. To have one place to store these dates and events instead of in different calendars, social media apps or notepads. 
For example: starting a new job, getting a promotion, memorable trip with spouce/partner, moving, family reunions, physical achievements and childrens developmental milestones.
